        <h3> Rice </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 pound basmati rice</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li> 1 large onion diced </li>
            <li> 5 pods of cardamon </li>
            <li> 3 whole cloves </li>
            <li> 1 (1inch) piece cinnamon stick </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger </li>
            <li> 1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
            <li> 4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <h2> Directions </h2>
        <h4> Step 1 </h4>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p>
        <h4> Step 2 </h4>
        <p> Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. </p>
        <h4> Step 3 </h4>
        <p> Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</p>
        <h4> Step 4 </h4>
        <p> Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
        <h4> Step 5 </h4>
        <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. </p>
        <h4> Step 6 </h4>
        <p> Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p>
        <h4> Tip </h4>
        <p> You can use ghee instead of vegetable oil for more authentic taste </p>
